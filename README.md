# Spellcasting Scripts
 Scripts used in the tutorial
The Sample project does NOT have the free unity assets in it since this is not allowed by the license of the unity asset store, you can download these in the Unity asset store.

If you want to use the scripts you can download the sample project.

OR

You can download the unity package which holds all the scripts in it

Disclaimer:

The scripts in this repository were developed with the goal of driving the visuals in my Unity particle and shader tutorial. While they serve as a functional starting point, they are not intended to be used as a fully developed system in production. These scripts provide a foundation that can be refactored and extended to suit your specific needs.
